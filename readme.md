## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask_app.git
   cd flask_app
   ```

2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. You can follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if needed.

## Docker Setup

This project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and run the application and MySQL as services.

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to connect to the MySQL database:

- `MYSQL_HOST`: The hostname of the MySQL server (default is `db`).
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: The name of the database (default is `flask_app`).
- `MYSQL_USER`: The MySQL user (default is `root`).
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: The MySQL user password (set to `Shahid`).

These variables are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Database Initialization

The `create_database_and_tables.sql` script is automatically executed when the MySQL container starts for the first time.

## Build and Start the Containers

To build and start the Docker containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This command will create and start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, rebuilding the images if there have been any changes.



## Running the Application

Once the containers are up and running, the Flask application will be accessible at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

You can access the application in your web browser.

## Stopping and Removing Containers

To stop and remove the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command will stop and remove the running containers along with the associated networks.
